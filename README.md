# LoginForm

A full-stack login and register form using 
node js and MongoDB database. implemented password hashing for secure logins using bycrypt. 
planning on continuing this project to add cookies and sessions. 
Had a headache of problems trying to deploy it on render due to MongoDB connection issues but I finally pulled it off ðŸŽ‰
